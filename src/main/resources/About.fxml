The Gauss-Seidel method is the numerical technique behind all of this, used to provide a numerical solution to the system of equations governing fluid flow, (the Navier-Stokes equations). Specifically, it's employed to solve the pressure equation, which is crucial for maintaining incompressibility in fluid simulations. The method iteratively updates the pressure values of each grid cell based on the pressure values of neighbouring cells. It starts with an initial guess for the pressure distribution across the grid. Then, in each iteration, it updates the pressure of each cell by taking a weighted average of its neighbouring pressure values. This iterative process continues until the pressure values converge to a stable solution." textOverrun="CLIP" wrapText="true">

With fluid saving, users can pause the simulation at any point and save its current state, allowing them to revisit and analyse previous states or undo actions if needed. The rollback feature enables users to rewind the simulation to a previous state within a short-term memory window, providing flexibility for experimentation and error correction. Furthermore, users can step forward through the simulation at their preferred pace, allowing them to observe fluid dynamics in detail or process the simulation slower for closer analysis. Keybinds for these processes can be set within the settings page. (Return home to see)" textOverrun="CLIP" wrapText="true" />
